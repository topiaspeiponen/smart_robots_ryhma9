# C code for robot competition

This repository contains the C code that was used in programming a Zumo robot. The robot had to pass multiple challenges:
- A race against another robot where both had to follow a single black line to the finish
- A sumo wrestling match
- A rectangular labyrinth where obstacles were placed in some positions
